# emilytrybulec/argonaut: Documentation

The emilytrybulec/argonaut documentation is split into the following pages:

- [Usage](usage.md)
  - An overview of how the pipeline works and how to run it.
- [Output](output.md)
  - An overview of the different results produced by the pipeline and how to interpret them.

Although Argonaut is not an nf-core pipeline, it was build using an nf-core template and with the intention for widespread use. You can find a lot more documentation about installing, configuring and running nf-core pipelines on the website: [https://nf-co.re](https://nf-co.re)
